# magic methods in python  are speacial mehtods that start and end with double underscores (__).
# They ar also called dunder methods.
# These methods allow you to define or customize the behavior of python object for built in operations


# class Person:
#     def __init__(self, name):
#         self.name = name

# p = Person("salman")
# print(p.name)

# "For example, __init__ is a magic method that runs automatically when we create a new object to initialize it. If we do p = Person('salman'), Python internally calls Person.__init__(p, 'salman')."
