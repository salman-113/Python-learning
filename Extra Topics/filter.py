# In Python, the filter() function is used to filter out (select) elements from a sequence (like a list, tuple, etc.) based on a condition.

# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# def even(nums):
#     return nums % 2 == 0
# result = filter(even, numbers)
# print(list(result))

# using lambda for easy

# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# even_numbers = list(filter(lambda n: n % 2 == 0, numbers))
# print(even_numbers)
